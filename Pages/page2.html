            <p class="card-text">This is an animated TV special based on The Hobbit by J.R.R. Tolkien. It's definitely not a masterpiece, considering the designs are a bit weird-looking most of the time, and the animation is a bit limited due to their budget. Though, despite this, it does have some charm, and it's a bit entertaining to watch, especially as it is a pretty accurate adaptation for the most part.</p>

The film's animation is great, and the characters are interesting. The film also has a darker tone near the second half, which is emphasized by the lack of songs after the film's first half.</p>

It centers on a family of superheroes in a world where superheroes have been outlawed due to various controversies in the past. The film's animation is noticeably a bit older compared to what films have been released more recently, though the character designs and the visual style of the film still hold up pretty well. The story is also pretty strong, and the characters are written in a believeable way.</p>

The film also has good animation and character designs, which have aged well.</p>

            <p class="card-text">Batman: Mask of the Phantasm is an animated film which spun-off from Batman: The Animated Series. The plot revolves around Batman trying to stop a cloaked villain who has been killing people around Gotham City, who many assume is Batman himself. The film's animation is an improved version of the series' animation due to it having a higher budget, and it is also a bit darker than the main series since it was a theatrical release instead of being aired on television. It also has a well-written story as well.</p>

The film has a very nice art style, and the characters were designed by Mike Mignola, the creator of the Hellboy comics. It also has an interesting story, though it didn't do as well when it first came out due to it being more adventure-oriented compared to most other Disney films at the time.</p>

            <h5 class="card-title">2 - Prince of Egypt</h5>
            <p class="card-text">Prince of Egypt is an animated film that was released in 1998. It adapts the biblical story of Moses, though it also takes liberties with the source material to tell an interesting narrative, which it achieves. Being a musical, it has songs in it, and the songs add to the story really well. The character designs are also well-done, and the art style looks great!</p>

            <p class="card-text">Klaus is a holiday movie that was released on Netflix in 2019. It is written as an origin story for Santa Claus, where a selfish postman befriends an elderly toymaker named Klaus, and the two of them agree to give toys to the children in a nearby town as gifts. The film's animation is amazing and unique, as the director wanted to make a hand-drawn animated film where the actual animation had the same amount of detail as the poster and promotional art for the film would.</p>
