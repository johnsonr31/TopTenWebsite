              <p class="card-text">This is an animated TV special based on The Hobbit by J.R.R. Tolkien. It's definitely
                not a masterpiece, considering the designs are a bit weird-looking most of the time, and the animation
                is a bit limited due to their budget. Though, despite this, it does have some charm, and it's a bit
                entertaining to watch, especially as it is a pretty accurate adaptation for the most part. <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0077687/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Here is a link to the IMDB page.</a></p>

              <p class="card-text">Wall-E is an animated film by Pixar that was released in 2008. The premise involves a
                robot named Wall-E who is on Earth thousands of years in the future, where the entire earth is covered
                in garbage. Wall-E discovers a plant, which seems to be the last one on the earth, which he keeps, and
                he meets a robot named Eve who is looking for the plant. This film has great animation that tsill holds
                up today, and it has a heartwarming story as well. <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0910970/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">You can check out the IMDB page for more information.</a></p>

              <p class="card-text">Mulan is an animated film by Disney that was released in 1998. It is adapted from a
                Chinese ballad about a girl who is worried her father will die when he is drafted into war, and
                disguises as a man to take his place. The film's animation is great, and the characters are interesting.
                The film also has a darker tone near the second half, which is emphasized by the lack of songs after the
                film's first half. <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120762/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">If you're interested, you can find more information on IMDB.</a></p>

              <p class="card-text">Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse is an animated film released in 2018, and was based
                on multiple versions of the iconic superhero Spider-Man. The main protagonist of the film is Miles
                Morales, who gets bitten by a radioactive spider, and ends up meeting multiple different versions of
                Spider-Man who help train him to become Spider-Man himself. The film has a very unique style, almost
                looking like a comic book in motion. The characters are also written well, especially Miles, who is an
                interesting character and has character growth throughout the course of the film. <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4633694/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">There's more information about this film on its IMDB page.</a></p>

              <p class="card-text">The Incredibles is an animated film that was released in 2004. It centers on a family
                of superheroes in a world where superheroes have been outlawed due to various controversies in the past.
                The film's animation is noticeably a bit older compared to what films have been released more recently,
                though the character designs and the visual style of the film still hold up pretty well. The story is
                also pretty strong, and the characters are written in a believeable way. <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0317705/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Here's the IMDB page for this film, if you're interested in reading more about it.</a></p>

              <p class="card-text">Up is an animated film that was released in 2009. It is about an elderly man named
                Carl Fredrickson who uses a bunch of balloons to lift his house and visit a place in South America
                called Paradise Falls, as he had promised his late wife Ellie that they would visit there. The film's
                intro is very emotional, as it shows Carl and Ellie meeting for the first time, and goes on a montage of
                them living out their lives together, with Carl eventually being alone after Ellie passes on. The film
                also has good animation and character designs, which have aged well. <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1049413/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">If you want to read more, you can check out the IMDB page.</a></p>

              <p class="card-text">Batman: Mask of the Phantasm is an animated film which spun-off from Batman: The
                Animated Series. The plot revolves around Batman trying to stop a cloaked villain who has been killing
                people around Gotham City, who many assume is Batman himself. The film's animation is an improved
                version of the series' animation due to it having a higher budget, and it is also a bit darker than the
                main series since it was a theatrical release instead of being aired on television. It also has a
                well-written story as well. <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0106364/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">If you want to read more, you can check out the IMDB page.</a></p>

                is about a man named Milo Thatch who ends up being a part of a crew that goes to search for the lost
                city of Atlantis. The film has a very nice art style, and the characters were designed by Mike Mignola,
                the creator of the Hellboy comics. It also has an interesting story, though it didn't do as well when it
                first came out due to it being more adventure-oriented compared to most other Disney films at the time. <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0230011/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">You can read more about this film on IMDB if you're interested.</a></p>

                story of Moses, though it also takes liberties with the source material to tell an interesting
                narrative, which it achieves. Being a musical, it has songs in it, and the songs add to the story really
                well. The character designs are also well-done, and the art style looks great! <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120794/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Here's a link to this film's IMDB page, if you're interested in seeing more about it.</a></p>

              <h5 class="card-title">1 - Klaus</h5>
              <p class="card-text">Klaus is a holiday movie that was released on Netflix in 2019. It is written as an
                origin story for Santa Claus, where a selfish postman befriends an elderly toymaker named Klaus, and the
                two of them agree to give toys to the children in a nearby town as gifts. The film's animation is
                amazing and unique, as the director wanted to make a hand-drawn animated film where the actual animation
                had the same amount of detail as the poster and promotional art for the film would. <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4729430/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">If you're interested in learning more about the film, you can visit its IMDB page to read more about it.</a></p>
