            Tyreek Hill and paying him has payed off, he is having a outstanding season. He is the first person to reach 1000 WR yards this early in the seasone.
            Tue has been playing at a MVP Level some say, he defelnlty deserves the praise, Dolphins air raid offense is elite.

          <p class="frame">Lamar Jackson has been playing at a MVP level, he has help lead them to a 6-3 record. He has beem more of a pocket QB this year amd it is working.
            He only uses his legs when he needs to. They had some early struggles with blowing leads but it seems they hace got everything on track with a dimninate win over the Saints.

            They can get after the QB. They also have great CB talent with trevon diggs helping out in the secondary.

          <img class="frame" src="../Pages/assets/giants.png" alt="">
          <p  class="frame">The Giants have always had the telent. They proved that they just needed a coach to put it all together. Thanks to brian dayball they have been able 
            to do that. With a record of 6-2 they have benn wining games. All of there wins have been dicided by no less then 7b points. The defnse is doing its jov holding the 
            opposing team to less points, and Daniel Jones is not turning the ball over at a extremly high rate anymore.

          <p class="frame">No surprise here, the Cheifs have been on top of power rankings for almost the last ten yeers, thanks to any ried. 
            Mahomes has been playing like Mahomes. He is in the lead for MVP. Many think there would be a down tunr in his play
            Due to KC trading away Tyreek Hill. But Mahomes is proving that he dosent need him, he is the favriote at the moment tro win MVP, and is carriying 
            his team to victory.

            running game with Dalvin Cook. Kirk Cousins is also playing at a high level. The defsne is somewhat holding it own, but the offense
            is putting up points to win games.

          <p class="frame">The eagles where expected to be a playoff team coming into the seasone, but they now sit atop the NFL with a perfect record of 8-0. They mad many moves in the offseaons, and during the seasone,
            they drafted really really good, and traded for defenseive talent twice during the year. They are not waiting to build anymore, they are going all in win now mode. They are playing at elite level, 
            Thanks to new WR AJ Brown. They brought him in to pair with devonte smith, and it is paying of big time. Jalen Hurts is also playing at a elite level.
